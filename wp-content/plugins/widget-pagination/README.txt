This plugin lets you add a stylable pagination for the widgets: Archives, Categories, Links,
Meta, Pages, Individual Pages, Recent Posts and Recent Comments.

== Description ==

You can chose the (standard Wordpress) widget, which is to be paginated, and set the items
to show per widget page individually.
You can also set the number of pages to show and change the labels of the previous/next link,
as well as let the widget pages turn automatically.
Finally, you can change the default styling to match your theme.

**Plugin's Official Site**

See a demo at: http://wgpag.jana-sieber.de/

**Languages**

* English
* Deutsch
* Român (provided by Alexander Ovsov)

**Browser Compatibility**

positively tested with the latest Firefox, Chrome and Edge

**Plans**

* bullet points instead of numbers in pagination (let's be modern)
* animated paging (a few sexy effects)
* support of more widget types than the current standard 8 ones (what others do you need paginated?)
* instant preview of option changes on the plugin settings page (we don't like surprises, do we)

== Installation ==

Use wordpress' built-in installer, or upload and unzip widget_pagination.zip to your
/wp-content/plugins/ directory.

You will find 'Widget Pagination' menu in your WordPress admin panel in the 'Appearance'
area (where you also add widgets to the sidebar).

== Screenshots ==

1. Examples for some widgets in the Twenty Sixteen Theme.

2. Example for plugin settings page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the plugin work for other widget types, too? =

Sorry, currently it only works for the standard widgets, that come with Wordpress.

= How can I prevent my pagination from being broken up on two lines? =

You can try to decrease the 'max. items' count and/or the font sizes in the settings.

= How can I change the order of the list elements? =

Sorry, the plugin is not able to do that as the lists are generated by the theme. Check the
options in the widget itself - some offer to chose the order.

= Why can't I see a pagination on my widgets? =

Either your settings are not correct (check the 2nd screenshot) or your theme generates the
widgets differently than Wordpress. Send us a link to your website, then we will try to help.
